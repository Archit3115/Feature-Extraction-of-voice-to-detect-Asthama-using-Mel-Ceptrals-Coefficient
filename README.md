# Feature-Extraction-of-voice-to-detect-Asthama-using-Mel-Ceptrals-Coefficient
Asthma affects the airways to and fro from human lungs, due to blockage of air breathing problem also occurs. People suffering from this type of problems are said to be asthmatic. In this paper a feature extraction technique is applied for extracting similar features in asthmatic patients and normal human being. Mel â€“ frequency Cepstral Coefficient technique is used for feature extraction process. As there is no proper cure for this disease and treatment is too costlier, here is a start up of diagnosing this disease in initiation stages using this technique.
